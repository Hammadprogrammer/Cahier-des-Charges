## Introduction

The project aims to deliver a modern UI for recruiters. It includes features such as filtering candidates based on their status (Screened, Scheduled, Hired, Dismissed), viewing detailed candidate information through modals, and integrating a calendar for scheduling interviews.

The development is done purely in **Next.js** with **Tailwind CSS**. Data is simulated with mock data (no back-end integration).

## Features

### Candidate Status Tabs
1. **Screened**: Displays pre-qualified candidates with a score, position, and date of pre-selection.
2. **Scheduled**: Displays candidates with upcoming interview schedules and links to the calendar.
3. **Hired**: Displays candidates who have been hired, with relevant hiring details.
4. **Dismissed**: Displays candidates who have been rejected, along with reasons or dates.

Each tab includes filtering options, such as by skillset, date, etc., and adapts to mobile and desktop views.

### Candidate Modals
- **Experience**: Lists previous jobs, with roles, companies, and dates in a timeline or list.
- **Certifications & Skills**: Displays certifications, languages, and other skills in a categorized manner.
- **Nguyen Calendar**: An interactive calendar for scheduling and managing candidate interviews, with a weekly/monthly view and available slots.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: A React framework for building server-side rendered applications.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Mock Data**: Simulated data for front-end development (no back-end integration).
